# Particle-Swarm-Optimization
Calculate the numerical expression using PSO</br>
BJTU C++ Final Project.

# What is an optimization algorithm?
It is to find the best solution to optimize the problem from a set of selectable solutions.</br>

# What is PSO algorithm?
PSO is an iterative optimization algorithm that attempts to simulate social behavior.</br>
It works better with moving together to achieve a goal than when acting alone.</br>
PSO can measure results through a set of possible candidates, sharing information called individual particles.</br></br>
